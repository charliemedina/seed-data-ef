# seed-data-ef

In this project, I will be implementing a database and the relationships in your tables using Entity Framework. 
That database will be initialized with fake data and the migrations will run automatically. 

Once this is done then a series of SQL queries can be completed as part of a test. 
Finally these queries will be implemented with LINQ that will be consumed with the help of Postman.
